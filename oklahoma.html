                        <h3>Creation History</h3>
                        <p>
                            Oklahoma gained statehood on November 16, 1907, and by 1911 
                            had adopted their first flag. The Original Oklahoma flag was designed 
                            by Ruth Clement and incorporated a red backdrop with a white star
                            highlighted in the center. The star was trimmed in blue and featured
                            the number 46 in its center, signifying Oklahoma&apos;s admittance as
                            the 46th state. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, later in the early parts of the 20th century, due to the fear of
                            communism, which was spearheaded by events such as the Russian
                            October revolution of 1917 and anarchist bombings in the US (known
                            as the first Red Scare), a decision to change the Oklahoma flag was made.
                            This was due to Oklahoma&apos;s flag consisting of an all-red backdrop,
                            a color closely associated with the communist political movement.
                            A contest was held by the Daughters of the American Revolution,
                            with Louise Fluke designing the winning entry, consisting of an Osage
                            war shield crossed with a calumet and olive tree branch, centered
                            over a field of blue. This design holds true to this day with the only slight
                            change occurring in 1941, when <q>Oklahoma</q> was added in white,
                            Eurostile typeface as an initiative to combat illiteracy in the state.

                        <h3>Features</h3>
                        <p>
                            Oklahoma has deep-seated roots in the history and heritage of Native
                            Americans (some good and some bad), which is depicted in the state&apos;s
                            flag. The state is one of only two US flags to portray Native American
                            imagery, illustrated by an Osage war shield and calumet pipe. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Osage shield is a nod to an actual 1890&apos;s bison rawhide Osage war
                            shield belonging to chief Black Dog II, who was a company commander
                            in the Osage Battalion, a Native American military unit of the Confederate
                            States Army. This element pays homage to the Native American heritage
                            of the state, honoring its indigenous roots. Together with the calumet and
                            olive branch, the three combine to represent defensive warfare and protection.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the shield, there are 6 horizontally aligned crosses depicted inside
                            the shield and 7 feathers of which hang from its bottom margin. The
                            six crosses are meant to resemble the Native American configuration of
                            the stars. They symbolize high ideals, holding the people within the state
                            to standards of honesty and integrity in all facets of life. The seven feathers 
                            are a nod to the many tribes who inhabit the state of Oklahoma, specifically
                            recognizing the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Quapaw,
                            and Osage tribes.

                            The calumet (peace pipe) and olive branch are superimposed in a diagonal
                            cross over the Osage shield and have a combined meaning when depicted
                            beside each other. By themselves, the calumet, a sacred object in many
                            Native tribes used in a variety of ceremonies for prayer or sealing of a
                            treaty (typically associated with peace), denotes the Indigenous People
                            who inhabit the state. While the olive branch corresponds to European
                            settlers and is a classical representation of peace in western society.
                            Although the two societies have had varying conflicts throughout America&apos;s
                            history, such as the American Indian war and the Trail of Tears (the latter
                            being the forced relocation of many Indigenous tribes to the Oklahoma
                            territory, attributing to its high Native American population), the calumet
                            (Native American&apos;s) and olive branch (European settlers) are the
                            symbolized desire for peace between the two communities, as each
                            stands for tranquility within their respective cultures. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The field of French blue in which the war shield, calumet, and
                            olive branch reside, is a credit to the first official Native American
                            flag flown in Oklahoma, the Choctaw battle flag. This flag was raised by
                            the men of the Second Indian Brigade, a native American military troop in
                            the confederate army of the American Civil War. The color also is meant
                            to represent devotion and loyalty, emphasizing unity amongst all the
                            people of Oklahoma. Also depicted atop the blue background, in the
                            bottom portion of the flag is the word <q>Oklahoma</q> in white lettering.
                            This was placed on the flag to combat rising illiteracy rates within the state
                            and highlight the state to which the flag belonged.
