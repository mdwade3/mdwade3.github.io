                    <p>
                        In today&apos;s age, flags are seen throughout many walks of life, 
                        such as international relations, sporting events, religious gatherings, 
                        and rallies and protests. All of these are different and yet in each 
                        one you will see flags being raised, some in defiance while others 
                        are held in high regard. With 195 countries in the world, there is a 
                        vast number of differences between every one of us, however there is 
                        one symbol that traverses almost all societies: the flag. This is because 
                        flags represent more than just colors and symbols, they share the 
                        country&apos;s history, represent its people, and work unify those under it.

                    <h3>Brief History of Flags</h3>
                    <p>
                        Flags originate from vexilloids, used by military leaders 
                        as a visible sign to rally around or point out attacks. Later, when 
                        silk was invented in China these vexilloids morphed into banners 
                        that were both easier to carry and more visible from a distance. Over time this 
                        tradition spread from China to Europe, and by the 12th century 
                        morphed from a military symbol, to serving as a way for identifying nobility 
                        and their domain. Over the next few centuries cities and guilds would 
                        adopt their own flags, with the first modern flag (the Dutch revolutionary
                        Prinsenvlag) appearing by the end of the 16th century. This, along with 
                        the abolition of most European monarchies, brought colors and designs to 
                        flags that took on ideological and political meaning.
