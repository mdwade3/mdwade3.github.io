                            Most national flags are rectangular. The only non-rectangular national
                            flags being Vatican City and Switzerland as theirs are of square
                            shape, and Nepal, which has the only 5-sided flag consisting
                            of two horizontally directed triangles placed vertically on top
                            one another.

                           Rectangular shaped flags hold prominence due to
                            European imperialism in which European powers spread their
                            influence across the globe, resulting in traditions (such as the
                            rectangular flag) becoming adopted by vastly different cultures.

                        <h3>Proportions</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Proportions of a flag are the ratio of the width to the length. 
                            The width of a flag is the vertical measurement, measured along 
                            the flags hoist (half of flag nearest to the staff). The length of the 
                            flag is measured from the hoist to the fly (the opposite end to the 
                            staff, mirrors the hoist).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When flags are placed beside each other in international affairs 
                            or large spectacles (i.e. Olympics), to retain uniformity, organizers typically
                            attempt to configure all flags to adopt the same proportions. This can
                            lead to distortion of elements since not all rectangular flags are
                            exactly proportional. Therefore, to fix this, it is customary to standardize
                            all flags to the hoist width allowing proportions to be retained, while
                            the length of flags still varies.

                            The basic parts of the flag are the hoist (first half), fly (second half),
                            top (upper half), and bottom (lower half). These work together to form
                            the flag outline displayed in the diagram below:

                            In Europe, many flags are historic armorial banners that date back
                            to the medieval ages and thus, must be described in heraldic terms.
                            However, here we will only be discussing modern flags that are based
                            on simple divisions and charges (objects or figures placed on the field of a flag,
                            typically used for symbolism)rather than the more elaborite historical flags of the past.

                                Single colors and color combinations are the main way a flag conveys
                                its symbolic meaning. Colors can be displayed to resemble political
                                factions, religious ideologies, national heritage, geographical regions, or
                                hold heraldic meaning. There are many colors used in a plethora
                                of flags throughout the world, with each color holding a different, meaningful
                                context for their respective nation (i.e. The red in the Vietnam&apos;s flag stands for the
                                communist revolution, while in Spain&apos;s, it is a heraldic remembrance
                                of some of the oldest Spanish kingdoms).

                                of an independent state, it acts as a flag and ensign (maritime flag for
                                national identification) used by government officials, navy, and general public.

                                or special design.

                                A standard flag can take on one of four meanings. First, it can
                                be a vexilloid (serves same purpose as flag with slightly different appearance)
                                used by the army. Second, a long tapering flag of heraldic design, with its
                                size corresponding to the person&apos;s rank. Third, a rectangular flag seen typically
                                in national flags. Finally, a flag used to represent the head of state.

                                Because of this, they are larger at the hoist than at the fly typically coming to
                                point or narrowing the further it extends from the flagpole. Originally used at
                                sea, however in modern day, are used as awards and souvenirs for sports and
