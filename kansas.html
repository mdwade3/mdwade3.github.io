                        <h3>Creation History</h3>
                        <p>
                            While Kansas was admitted to the Union on January 29, 1861, 
                            it did not adopt an official state flag until March 21,1927. The 
                            process for acquiring a state flag began in 1916 when a flag 
                            design contest was held by the Daughters of the American 
                            Revolution (a federally chartered organization for women 
                            descended from patriots of the American Revolution). The 
                            winner was Esther Nortrup whose design consisted of three 
                            red, white, and blue horizontal strips and a depiction of the 
                            state seal surrounded by a sunflower in the canton (upper left). 
                            This flag was submitted to legislator but ultimately did not pass 
                            due to pressures from organizations such as the Grand Army 
                            of the Republic, who said any state flag would combat the 
                            US national flag and defy unity amongst the nation, while others 
                            simply thought of the sunflower as a weed that should not 
                            represent the state. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometime later a banner would be created by Albert T. Reid, 
                            depicting a sunflower and the state seal, centered in a field of 
                            blue, and draped with golden fringes. This satisfied the 
                            Grand Army of the Republic, but groups such as the Daughters 
                            of the American Revolution and the Kansas National Guard 
                            were left unappeased. To make matters worse, the display 
                            of the Kansas state banner was rejected for display among 
                            the state flags in Washington, leaving Kansas with no physical 
                            state representation in the nation&apos;s capital. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It wasn&apos;t until General Milton R. Mclean pushed for Kansas 
                            to adopt an official state flag that any headway was gained 
                            toward the resolution on the matter. Ultimately, a design by 
                            Hazel Avery that included a field of blue with the state seal 
                            in the center and a sunflower on top was passed by legislation on 
                            March 21, 1921, finally after nearly 60 years of statehood giving 
                            Kansas its first official state flag. In 1961, the addition of the 
                            word <q>Kansas</q> was added in gold block lettering at the bottom 
                            of the flag, and it hasn&apos;t changed since.

                        <p>
                            The Kansas state flag depicts a sunflower on top a red and blue 
                            stripped wreath with the state seal in the center and the word 
                            <q>Kansas</q> in gold block lettering engulfed in blue backdrop. The 
                            Sunflower is one of the most common state symbols of Kansas, 
                            representing both the state and its people. The flower even takes 
                            hold in the states nickname <q>the Sunflower state</q> due to the 
                            abundance of Wild Native Sunflowers throughout Kansas. 
                            Beneath the sunflower, is a blue and yellow striped wreath meant 
                            to represent an 1803 land treaty, known as the Louisiana 
                            Purchase. This purchase would mark a key moment in US history 
                            as it would act as the catalyst for the great western expansion 
                            and manifest destiny as American&apos;s flocked to settle the west and 
                            its territories for the opportunities they believed were provided. 
                            The Kansas territory was included in this purchase, resulting 
                            in many new settlers in the early parts of the 19th century.

                            The Kansas state seal includes many elements that ultimately 
                            tell the story of Kansas&apos;s past and history. The seal, created by 
                            senator John Ingalls in 1861, includes the phrase (and state motto) 
                            <q>Ad astra per aspera</q> meaning <q>To the Stars through Difficulties</q>
                            signifying the political struggles the state endured in the leadup 
                            to its admission as a free state in 1961. This period was known as 
                            Bleeding Kansas and resulted from the dispute over legality of 
                            slavery in the territory, leading to violent civil conflicts between 
                            1854-1861. Kansas&apos;s eventual admission as free state was 
                            approved by the House of Representatives but had been blocked 
                            by southern senators until 1961 when Abraham Lincoln was 
                            elected president, paving the way for Kansas to achieve statehood 
                            as the 34th state, depicted by the 34 stars on the flag in the upper portion of the state seal.

                            The rising eastward sun, along with the wagon train and log cabin pays 
                            homage to the settlers that took the opportunity to relocate to 
                            the new lands of the Kansas territory. The rising sun signifies the 
                            east and how the settlement of the west marked a new beginning in 
                            American history where those who sought the opportunity of a new 
                            life could find it in the uncharted lands to the west. The wagon train 
                            in combatant with the state&apos;s motto (see above) has the added 
                            meaning of signifying the difficulties western settlers endured in the 
                            trek for a better life.

                            The bison is the state&apos;s animal, yet another symbol of the state of Kansas. 
                            In the seal, Native American&apos;s are shown hunting a heard of buffalo, 
                            a common pastime of the Plains Indian people. These hunting parties 
                            were a fundamental activity that supplied meat and fur for both their 
                            society and economy, up until the animals near extinction due to the 
                            US&apos;s expansion of the west. For the Plains tribes, bison hunting also 
                            acted as a form of spiritual and religious practice due to the buffalo&apos;s 
                            perception as a sacred animal amongst their people.

                            amount of the US&apos;s grain, corn, and meat (beef). These products 
                            are then transported along waterways, such as the Kansas and 
                            Missouri river, (depicted by the steamboat and river), both of which
