                        <h3>Creation History</h3>
                        <p>
                            Arizona&apos;s flag was created by Colonel Charles Wilfred 
                            Harris of the Arizona National Guard to serve as a representation 
                            of the national guard&apos;s rifle team during competitions. Initially, 
                            legislation failed to pass in 1915, which would have made it the 
                            official state flag of Arizona, due to similarities with Japan&apos;s current flag. 
                            However, the design would eventually pass, and on February 27, 
                            1917, was adopted as the official state flag of Arizona and has 
                            been the flag ever since.  
                        </p>

                    <section class="contentextragridbottom content">
                        <h3>Features</h3>
                        <p>
                            Arizona&apos;s flag consists of alternating red and yellow sun beams 
                            displayed horizontally along the top half, with a <q>liberty blue</q> colored 
                            foreground, and a copper star in the center. The alternating red 
                            and yellow sunbeams have three simultaneous meanings hidden 
                            withing them. First, the two colors (red and yellow) are a tribute 
                            to some of the earliest explorers of the Arizona region during the 
                            mid sixteenth century. These Spanish explores, known as conquistadores, 
                            were headed by Francisco Vazquez de Coronado and are credited 
                            with traversing much of the present-day southwestern United States 
                            and Mexico with the hopes of finding the seven cities of gold, discovering 
                            landmarks such as the Grand Canyon along the way. The sunbeams 
                            second meaning is in the number of alternating stripes (<q>sunbeams</q>) 
                            within the design. There are thirteen stripes in total which are salute to 
                            the original thirteen colonies that receded from British rule in 1776, 
                            therefore, joining together to establish the United States of America. 
                            Lastly, the sunbeams are a representation of a westward setting sun, signifying 
                            Arizona&apos;s geographic location in the southwestern region of the US.

                            The <q>Liberty Blue</q> color depicted in the bottom half of the Arizona flag is 
                            another nod to the country in which it belongs, as it is the same hue as seen 
                            on the national flag of the United States. It also is meant to resemble 
                            a principal river of the southwest, the Colorado river. This river is 
                            known for carving the Grand Canyon, a landmark that is one of 
                            the seven natural wonders of the world and Arizona&apos;s largest tourist 
                            attraction. It also supplies the water necessary to operate the Hoover 
                            Dam, generating power for utilities in Arizona, Nevada, and California. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the copper star, depicted in the center, credits the importance 
                            of copper mining within Arizona&apos;s infrastructure. Historically, the mining 
                            industry has played an important role in Arizona&apos;s economy, and 
                            copper has been its most abundant resource and chief export, accounting 
                            for 65% of all US copper.
